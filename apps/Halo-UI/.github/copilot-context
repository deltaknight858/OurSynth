Copilot Instructions for OurSynth‑Eco
Vision & Principles
Unified Platform: Pathways (prompt-driven app generator), Deploy (orchestration/status), Domains (management), Store/Showcase (platform & premium apps), Halo UI (design system)
Design Principles: Minimal surface area, composability, strong defaults, visual coherence via Halo UI
Philosophy: "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast." — deliberate, inevitable progress
Monorepo Layout (Turborepo + Changesets)
Why Turborepo: Fast caching, layered builds, simple mental model. Prefer custom scripts in workflows/ over Nx.
Halo UI: Foundation & Conventions
Tech: React + TypeScript, Tailwind, Radix Primitives, Framer Motion

Structure:
packages/halo-ui/
  src/
    tokens/       # theme.ts, motion.ts, shadows.ts
    primitives/   # Button, Input, Switch, Dialog, Tabs, Tooltip
    surfaces/     # Card, Panel, Sheet, GlassLayer
    feedback/     # Toast, Progress, Skeleton
    data/         # Table, List, EmptyState
    app-ops/      # PromptInput, ModelSelector, DeployBadge, DomainBadge
    hooks/        # useTheme, useMotionPref, useKeypress
    css/          # halo.css (CSS vars), tailwind-plugin.ts
  index.ts
Design Tokens:
Colors: Halogen palette (plasma/neon), neutrals for glass
Elevation: Blurs, inner/outer glows
Motion: Micro-interactions (100–250ms), page transitions (250–400ms), spring presets
Rounding: 10/14/18 for geometry, 9999 for pills
Density: Compact/comfy via CSS vars
Theming: CSS variables in halo.css, Tailwind plugin for utilities, data-theme="dark|light|neon" for runtime switching, Radix reset included
