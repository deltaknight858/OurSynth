# OurSynth-Eco Monorepo

Welcome to the **OurSynth-Eco** platform!  
This monorepo powers the modular, local-first, and peer-to-peer app ecosystem for OurSynth, including Pathways, Deploy, Domains, Studio, and the OAI Orchestrator.

## 🗂️ Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
  web/        # Main Next.js web app (marketing, store, account, docs)
  deploy/     # Deploy app (deploy to Azure/Vercel, status)
  domains/    # Domains app (custom domain mapping, DNS verification)
  studio/     # Studio/IDE app (optional)
  halo-ui/    # UI kit demo or playground
  oai/        # OAI Orchestrator (agent/event bus, tools, Calm bridge)
packages/
  halo-ui/    # Halo UI kit (glass, neon, motion, primitives)
  types/      # Shared TypeScript types (Capsule, integrations, etc.)
  integrations/ # API clients for Pathways, Deploy, Domains, etc.
  oai/        # OAI orchestrator logic (tools, bus, capsule builder)
infra/
  supabase/   # Supabase SQL, migrations, and policies

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in Supabase, Stripe, and integration URLs.

3. **Run all apps**
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   # or run a single app:
   pnpm dev --filter web
   ```

4. **Build all packages**
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

## 🕰 Capsule System

Every app run can be exported as a signed Capsule:

- Contains code, build recipe, env, seeds, provenance, and rights
- Replayable, portable, and cryptographically signed
- Time Machine UI lets you scrub, diff, branch, and redeploy any state
- Peer-to-peer mesh sync and resale ready

See [`packages/types/capsule.ts`](packages/types/capsule.ts) for the manifest schema.

---

## 🧩 Integrations

- **Pathways**: Code generation and scaffolding
- **Deploy**: One-click deploy to Azure or Vercel
- **Domains**: Custom domain mapping and DNS verification
- **Calm**: Automated code edits and PRs
- **OAI**: Orchestrator/event bus for agentic workflows

---

## 🛡 Security & Best Practices

- All secrets in `.env.local` (never commit secrets)
- `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, `dist/` are gitignored
- Supabase RLS and signed URLs for secure data access

## 🛠️ Automation & Tooling

### Mesh Simulation

To run a mesh simulation with provenance tracking, use the `mesh-sim-provenance-and-preview.ps1` script. This is useful for testing capsule integrity and network conditions.

**Usage:**

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/mesh-sim-provenance-and-preview.ps1 -CapsuleHash <yourCapsuleHash> -Nodes 5 -Latency "50-150" -PacketLoss 0.05 -ChaosMode -VerifySignatures
```

This script can also be triggered from the Studio Command Center as the "Simulate Mesh" action.
